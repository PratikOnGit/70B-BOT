 **DEMO: https://70b-bot.vercel.app/**

*_*Major update : Recently, Vercel have silently reduced the serverless function execution timeout from 10s for the hobby plan, 60s for the pro plan and 1000s for the enterprise plan to, respectively, 5s, 15s and 30s. This might be the reason why you're experiencing this error now.
**_
I really didn't like the fact that they lowered these limits without warning their users (I wasn't warned, at least) and giving them time to adjust.
